Setup steps if you do not want to install webpack globally
Make sure you are working in your project directory (cd into your asteroids directory)

1. npm init -y
    * generates your `package.json`

2. npm install webpack wepback-cli
    * adds webpack dependencies

3. Add the following script to your `package.json`, under the scripts key
    * `"start": "webpack --watch --mode=development"`

4. You can then use this terminal command to run webpack for your project!
    * `npm start`

If you follow the folder structure outlined by the instructions then this should be all you need to do for webpack setup.
* The file tree should look something like this.
     
    ```
